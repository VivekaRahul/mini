   <p><b>Longevity is a priority for a new kitchen so you need to ensure your chosen kitchen color ideas are styles that you will love to live with for many years,' says Ben.

‘A classic color tends to stand the test of time so deep blues, greens and grays are always a good choice if you worry about your kitchen dating. Wood cabinets can always be repainted if you want to refresh your scheme in the future.’

‘When choosing your kitchen paint colour, the first thing to consider is your overall scheme. A concise palette creates a sophisticated look so choose a color for your cabinetry and complement it with one or two accents.’

One of the great things about incorporating color into a kitchen is that you can go wild or you can add just a hint of a hue.

If you have a neutral kitchen and you’re not quite sure what colors to include, look around your home or even your closet for inspiration. More often than not, you will be surrounded by colors that you feel comfortable with so it is a good idea to follow those shades through in the kitchen.

‘Making a decision about which colors to use in the kitchen is never simple, with endless options for not only the color of the walls, but also matching the cabinetry,' explains Lara Hughes, Kitchen Designer at Neptune. 'Lighter paint hues are a perfect tool for balancing tones in the kitchen and creating contrast.' 

'One of the most popular routes to take is to have a coloured kitchen island. Using one color throughout creates serenity and can feel just as restful as soothing neutrals, whilst also making the room feel larger, too.’  

Exactly just how bold you want to go and how many colors you want to bring in up to you, but our kitchen color ideas are such to leave you feeling inspired...
